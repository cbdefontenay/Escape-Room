# Escape-Room

### An Escape Room Game writen in C#

The idea was to work with C# and test the language through a cool game.
This is a Console App, you can run it in **Visual Studio** for example.

If you run it with the _Dotnet_ CLI, in **Visual Studio Code** for example, run this command
to run the game:

```C#
Dotnet run
```
